# colorspin
a small site for color palette management and experimentation.

There are countless tools available on and offline to create and manage color palettes. However, I find that existing solutions lack certain features that are important to me as a designer and developer.

### I would like to: 
- create new color palettes
  - intuitive color picking interface
  - suggestions for colors based on colors I have already selected
  - color harmonies
- manage color palettes I have created in the past
  - tagging
  - editing
- understand color trends within different contexts
  - how to determine color trends???
- see how my color palette might look in different scenarios
  - motion graphics
  - basic mock layouts 
- export my color palettes in formats that are useful to me
  - rgb 0-255 or 0-1
  - HSL
  - hex
  - pantone
  - what else????? 
  
This project is built on create-react-app.
